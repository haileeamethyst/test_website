## Education

**Master of Science, Ecology** — Colorado State University 2025 (GPA: 3.8)\
**Graduate Certificate, Data Analysis** — Colorado State University 2025\
**Bachelor of Science, Restoration Ecology** (Minor: Entomology) — Colorado State University 2022\
**Associate of Arts**– Front Range Community College 2019

## Research Experience

### Student Researcher — Davis Lab of Forest Health, Entomology, Ecology & Biodiversity (CSU)

*July 2021–Present*\
- MSc research on **Monochamus** beetles as vectors of the **pinewood nematode (*Bursaphelenchus xylophilus*)** in wildfire-influenced forest systems\
- Field trapping across disturbance gradients; **LAMP** assays for nematode presence/absence; statistical modeling of spatial and temporal patterns

### Research Advisor — MURALS (Multicultural Undergraduate Research and Artistry Symposium)- First Year Scholars Academy (CSU)

*Sept 2025–Present*\
- Mentored three first-year undergraduates; designed and taught methods for a project comparing microbial communities in burned vs unburned ponderosa pine\
- Field sampling (bark and needles); lab work included fungal plating, Baermann funnels, and microscopy (e.g., nematodes, tardigrades, ciliates, rotifers)

### Research Intern — DAAD RISE Program (Research Internships in Science and Engineering), University of Göttingen (Germany)

*Summer 2022*\
- Forest zoology project examining Douglas-fir introduction and impacts on arthropod diversity and functioning\
- Implemented lure traps and artificial caterpillars to quantify biodiversity and predation rates in the forest canopy

### Student Researcher / Field Technician — Colorado Natural Heritage Program (UCCS, Mooney Lab)

*Summer 2021*\
- Studied ant–butterfly mutualisms in the rare hops azure butterfly (*Celastrina humulus*)\
- Monitored ant tending interactions as a function of host plant phenology

### Research Intern — U.S. Geological Survey / RECCS

*Summer 2019*\
- Hydrology field measurements and lab-based DNA extraction to quantify biomass flux in the Powder River as a potential contaminant-tracking approach

## Publications

Mooney, E. H., Fahland, A. C., **Nolan, H. A.**, Swift, A. M., & Schorr, R. (2023). Host-plant phenology mediates facultative ant mutualism in the rare butterfly, *Celastrina humulus* (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). *Environmental Entomology, 52*(6), 1082–1094.

Underwood, J. C., Moody, J. A., Martin, D. A., **Nolan, H. A.**, & Sullivan, J. (2025). Physical, chemical, and biological results from a Lagrangian study of water and sediment transported by Powder River… *U.S. Geological Survey data release.*

## Manuscripts in Preparation / Under Review

**Nolan, H. A.**, Davis, T. S., & Stewart, J. Wildfire is associated with a short-term increase of pathogenic pinewood nematode (*Bursaphelenchus xylophilus*) in populations of sawyer beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae).

**Nolan, H. A.**, Davis, T. S., & Stewart, J. Spruce beetle kill is not associated with an increase of pathogenic pinewood nematode (*Bursaphelenchus xylophilus*) in populations of sawyer beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), but presence of spruce beetle kill impacts sawyer beetle size.
