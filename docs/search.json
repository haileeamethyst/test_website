I study the role of Monochamus beetles as vectors of pine wilt disease in forest systems shaped by wildfire disturbance. My work sits at the intersection of insect ecology, forest health, and disease dynamics, with a focus on how environmental change influences vector–pathogen interactions.\nI recently completed my Master of Science at Colorado State University, where my research combines field-based beetle trapping, molecular nematode screening, and statistical modeling to evaluate how vector infection risk varies across spatial and temporal disturbance gradients. I am actively seeking PhD opportunities beginning Fall 2026 in entomology, forest ecology, or plant–insect–pathogen systems.\nOutside of research, I enjoy hiking with my dog Zylah, gardening, baking, and generally spending time outdoors and traveling!"
