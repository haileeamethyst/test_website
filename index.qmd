I am a forest ecologist specializing in forest entomology and disease ecology. I study the role of **Monochamus beetles** as vectors of **pine wilt disease** in forest systems shaped by wildfire disturbance. My work sits at the intersection of insect ecology, forest health, and disease dynamics, with a focus on how environmental change influences vector–pathogen interactions.

I recently completed my Master of Science at Colorado State University, where my research combines field-based beetle trapping, molecular nematode screening, and statistical modeling to evaluate how vector infection risk varies across spatial and temporal disturbance gradients. I am actively seeking **PhD opportunities** beginning Fall 2026 in entomology, forest ecology, or plant–insect–pathogen systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking with my dog Zylah, gardening, baking, and generally spending time outdoors and traveling!
